Q1. Describe an algorithm in pseudo-code 
then implement it as a program, one that 
can directly evaluate infix expressions 
of the form:

A+B-C/D-X, where only arithmatic operators
are used and there are no parantheses.

Q2. Write a program that can efficiently assess
whether an arithmatic expression in postfix
notation is valid or not. Evaluation of valid 
expressions is not required. Assume no
parantheses. 

Examples: xy+v-r/ is valid; c++ and +cc are
invalid.

Q3. Write a program that emulates the way in
which humans evaluate infix arithamtic expressions.

Q4. (advanced) Implement the shunting-yard algorithm 
for parsing mathematical expressions in infix notation.
