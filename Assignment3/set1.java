/*
Q1. Design, build and test a recursive function that returns the 
greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

Q2. Design, build and test a recursive function that returns the 
nth prime number, with 1 being the first prime. Beware of the computational
demands of recursion in practice.

Q3. Design, build and test a recursive function that generates the
first M terms of the Mandelbrot Set for a specific value of c (say 1).

Q4. Design, build and test a recursive algorithmic solution to the 
Knapsack Problem described on pages 305-6 of the textbook.
