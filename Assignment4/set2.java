/*
Q1. Design & implement a program that constrcuts binary trees capable 
of holding postfix arithmatic expressions, such as 14 23 + 7 - 12 *

Q2. Design & implement a binary tree utilizing program to hold
a string of integers (e.g., 181 728 67 1 3 8 377 18 1) then
output the numbers in ascending order.

Q3. Do Q2, but this time implement the tree using an array.

Q4. Design a program that accepts two binary search trees and 
merges them into one tree.
