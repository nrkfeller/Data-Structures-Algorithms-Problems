/*
Q1. Implement a Heap Sort using an array and in-place sorting.
Test it and output the results.

Q2. Implement a min heap: insert the following elements into 
it in order: 4,9,2,89,12,69,32,1,56,12,-12,190,-5,77.

Q3. Given an array of size n, split it into two arrays of ~n/2,
sort each one using heap sort then merge the resulting arrays 
into one array using merge sort. Output the result of one test.

Do not use more memory space than is minimally necessary.

Q4. Use a heap to implement a stack. Hint: the order or time 
of entry (which are increasing quantities) could be used as 
the key of the inserted element.
