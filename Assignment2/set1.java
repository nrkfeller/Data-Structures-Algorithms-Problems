Q1. Implement a deque using a double-linked list.

Q2. Design, implement and test a linked list that allows 
for the insertion of multiple objects with the same key at
the same location.

For example, if a list = [1.55.6.6.29.10]
then both items with key 6 should be placed at one and the same 
location in the list and both should be displayed if an inspection
is required. Deletion, however, deletes only one of them, while 
addition, adds still another object with the same key.

Q3. Is it possible to build an augmented linked list with
O(1) access time? Propose an idea, then compare the empirical 
results of your implementation to the expected theoretical performance.

Q4. Implement an array using a linked list.
